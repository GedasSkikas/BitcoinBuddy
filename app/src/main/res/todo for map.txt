test for the map looks exactly the same as for the other rest service, except the assertNotNull() stuff

RestClient.java currently only works for the bitcoin data. the restclient for the map looks completely the same, all you need to change is the baseURL
ok apiservice needs to be created aswell, looks the same but different url (i gonna write u in hangouts whats up with them)

the second restclient is gonna look like
<- done.

the second apiservice is gonna look like
<- done do u know what i mean?
ok you could put everything in the same apiservice, but you mb gonna lose control over it overtime if too much shit is in it.
mb just create ApiServiceBtcPrices, ApiServiceMap.
actually nvm
no, wait

ok, do you know what we did?
yes i think that should work, execute the old test to see if the no restclient still works

ohh, sec
pls nice it works
well, the old one still works c: we dont get any object yet.

ok, so what you gonna do now is,
- create the map data ( the object that u gonna retreive from the json, see the other in btc package for example)
- write the second test for map response
i think thats all u gonan need to do now, the map object might be tricky but u can ask if something is not clear c:
yy ill try and do that now c: ty go google hangouts
